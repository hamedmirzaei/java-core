## ExampleFromCodalityOnJava8.java
This example is going to make email addresses for a company personal. It takes personal names in a string each one separated by ";". They may have middle name and their names can contain "-". The resulting email for each personal should be like "firstLetterOfFirstName_familyNameWithoutDash@companyName.com" all in lower case letters. In case of redundant emails, add index 2, 3 and
so on to them (the first one does not have 1 at the end). At the end concat all the emails by ";" as a single string.
